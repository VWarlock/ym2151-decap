# YM2151 Vectorization
This project attempts to vectorize the die layers of a YM2151 FM Synthesis chip, with Operator Type M.

Although the layers file is standalone, it is best opened in Inkscape with an image of the die.

The die is a .png over 600MB large, and so is not committed in this repo. The die image can be downloaded here: https://og.kervella.org/ym2151/. This will require at least 2GB of memory. The die filename should not be changed from ym2151-metal.png so that the SVG interpreter can find the image when parsing the file.

Current status is:
Just Started!
