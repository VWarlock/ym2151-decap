jotego:
	Added large text for all pads
	Identified test structures and marked as "ignore"
	Digitised circuit at (3900, 6400)
	Found odd structure (resistor?) at (2618,6820)
	Found odd structure (capacitor?) at (2700,7000)
	Found odd structure (poly overlapping active with no apparent meaning) at (2414,6953)
	
	Discovered that pads alike have the same structure. Will try to make a pad as an unit,
	group the result and copy/paste to similar pads and see how it fits.
